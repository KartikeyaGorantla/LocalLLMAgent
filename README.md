# Example of what it can do with a single prompt

This local LLM agent is designed to run directly on your system with the help of an OpenAI API key. It is currently at a very nascent stage, and work is ongoing for more updates! At the moment, the agent can:

- Implement web applications and save them on the system.
- Check and debug its own code.
- Automatically call itself, check outputs from the compiler, and rewrite the code to correct itself.
- Has access to the Python & CMD local environments.
- Can push code to GITHUB (Yes, you read that right!)

Stay tuned for more features and improvements in the near future!
